I wanted a team-wide upgrade option that didn't feel as cheatsy as replacing every single upgrade, so I made this, a mixed solution to the team-upgrade problem.

## Adds upgrade bundles to the shop pool, appearing randomly alongside the default upgrades

Bundles have the following benefits:
* Applies the upgrade to all team members
* Cost 33% less than the individual upgrades would cost
* Counts as a singular upgrade purchase when it comes to calculating future upgrade costs

Note: If I can figure out how to do it without inline code editing, I want to make the bundles have a specific chance to override upgrades or perhaps have only 1 bundle TOTAL per shop cycle, but at the moment they are only limited to 1 bundle PER upgrade, per shop cycle, and simply add onto the default pool's weighting.
